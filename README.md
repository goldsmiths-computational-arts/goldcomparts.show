# goldcomparts.show

This repo exists to redirect to the current year's website. You should create a subdomain for your show, and then change the url in `index.html` so that this page redirects there. We have to use [meta refresh](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H76.html) as Github pages doesn't currently have a way to configure server-side redirects.
